Recipe website for the Odin Project
I'm not entirely sure if we're supposed to be writing most of this in only CLI or if I'm able to use VS CODE for it. I'm using VS Code for now, hopefully that's not wrong. I think I'll still use (or maybe have to use) the CLI for commits.
Anyway, this website is a project for The Odin Project (TOP) as a way to just start getting used to html and Git and Github. We'll see how it goes!
Update: I went back and saw that this is the way they taught us how to do it. AKA use the CLI for creating the file(s) and then edit them in VS Code. I'm on my way!
