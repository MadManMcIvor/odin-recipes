    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I'm not normally a fan of tomatoes. Don't get me wrong I like them in things like pizza and other sauces.</p>
    <p>But on their own tomatoes can be real gross. This recipe for bruschetta turns the normally repulsive tomatoes into something divine. Check it out!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/8 cup extra virigin olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 tsb minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>13 oz. roma tomatoes, diced (about 7 or 8)</li>
        <li>1/8 cup finely shredded parmaesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>3/8 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>some black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 cup chopped basil</li>
        <li>1/2 loaf of hearty bread cut into small slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For tomato mixture: Heat olive oil in a small skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic and saute until just starting to turn golden (don't brown it), about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour into a large mixing bowl. Let cool while you chop the tomatoes and basil.</li>
        <li>Pour tomatoes into bowl with cooled oil mixture. Add parmesan, basil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. Toss mixture well. Serve right away over toasted bread (spoon some of the juices along with it). Garnish with more parmesan if desired.</li>
        <li>To toast bread*: position oven rack a few inches below broil and preheat broiler. Align bread slices on an 18 by 13-inch baking sheet. Broil first side until golden brown, about 1 minute (don't walk away and keep and eye on them they'll brown quickly), then flip slices to opposite side and broil opposite side until golden brown.</li>
    </ul>
